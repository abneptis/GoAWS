BREAKAGE WARNING!
=================
  The API is going under some substantial cleanups;  If you are building from sources prior to Jun 20, 2011,
you will likely find near-zero one-one compatibility.
  - Generally, the new API's are applied to SQS, S3 and SDB (in progress)
  - Check godoc for the new structures & shapes.
  - The tools have been aggregated into a single built tool (in progress)

  Some key functions are not yet implemented (ACL's, subresources), 
and most of it is not yet thoroughly tested outside the direct 
paths required for the command line tool.

  For quick usage examples, see {elb,s3,simpledb,sqs}/util/*.go.  The tools are 
fully capable of basic administration of ELB, S3, SQS, and SimpleDB resources, but 
are intended primarily for testing and API usage examples.

  Please note, full compilation may depend on the following modules, also
available at github:


Alternatives (let me know if I miss any)
========================================
  goamz - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/goamz - seems to have much more complete
ec2 support, and s3

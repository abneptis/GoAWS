  After several revisions (read: rewrites), I finally have some AWS tools
I'm happy with the form of.

  Some key functions are not yet implemented (SQS and S3 deletion, S3 ACL's,
and others).

  For quick usage examples, see {s3,sqs}/tools/*.go.

  Please note, full compilation may depend on the following modules, also
available at github:

  - github.com/abneptis/GoURLTools  (com.abneptis.oss/urltools)
  - github.com/abneptis/GoMaptools  (com.abneptis.oss/maptools)
  - github.com/abneptis/GoCryptools (com.abneptis.oss/cryptools)
  - github.com/abneptis/GoUUID      (com.abneptis.oss/uuid)

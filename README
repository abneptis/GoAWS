  After several revisions (read: rewrites), I finally have some AWS tools
I'm happy with the form of.

  Some key functions are not yet implemented (ACL's, subresources), 
and most of it is not yet thoroughly tested outside the direct 
paths required for the command line tools.

  For quick usage examples, see {elb,s3,simpledb,sqs}/tools/*.go.  The tools are 
fully capable of basic administration of ELB, S3, SQS, and SimpleDB resources, but 
are intended primarily for testing and API usage examples.

  Please note, full compilation may depend on the following modules, also
available at github:

  - github.com/abneptis/GoURLTools  (com.abneptis.oss/urltools)
  - github.com/abneptis/GoMaptools  (com.abneptis.oss/maptools)
  - github.com/abneptis/GoCryptools (com.abneptis.oss/cryptools)
  - github.com/abneptis/GoUUID      (com.abneptis.oss/uuid)
